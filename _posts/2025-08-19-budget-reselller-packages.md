🔎 What Is SEO IP Hosting (2025 Edition)?
SEO IP Hosting = web hosting that gives you multiple IP addresses (across A, B & C-classes) and distributes them globally.
Why it matters for SEO:

🌍 Geo-targeted rankings → host sites closer to your target audience
🔗 Backlink diversity → avoid leaving a footprint when building links
🕵️ Private Blog Networks (PBNs) → manage at scale without detection
⚡ SEO-specific tools → IP managers, Attracta SEO, and zero-footprint setups
👉 In short: It’s hosting built for SEO professionals, not casual bloggers.
